# Housing Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing housing sales data using Python. The main goal is to explore the relationships between home features (such as number of rooms, size, etc.) and sale prices, and to build a predictive model for estimating prices.

## Tools Used
- pandas for loading and cleaning the data
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations
- scikit-learn for building regression models (Linear and Ridge)

## Analysis Steps
1. Download the dataset from an external CSV source
2. Explore and clean the data (handle missing values)
3. Analyze correlations between features
4. Split the data and train a predictive model
5. Evaluate the model's performance

## File
- `E-commerce_Analytics.ipynb`: Contains the full code for data analysis and model building

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab  
2. Run the cells in order  
3. Make sure you're connected to the internet to download the dataset
